# Metadesk Library: RAD Debugger's Standalone Fork

**Note: This repo is under heavy WIP. Currently getting the code from RAD's (Epic Games) Debugger over to a standalone state while at the same time studying it.**

**Update:**
This will contain just the minimal lib. Extra additions or the ability to generate variants will be in another repo (Currently removing excess).

This is a fork that aims to make the latest version of metadesk available from the [RAD Debugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger) accessible as a library.

docs will be updated referencing content procued by Ryan Fleury and content based on studying or resolving this library for this repo.
