# Metadesk Library

WIP: This hosts the raddbg's verion of mdesk module lifeted for use as a library. Intent is to get it working with tests & examples as the original was able to, then reduce the surface area of the base & os mdoules that it originally was dependent on to a minimal size. Before dependencies removal the modules will be hosted on a separate repo as a frozen state of their "libification".
