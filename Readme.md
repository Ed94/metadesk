# Metadesk (RADDBG Standalone Fork)

**Note: This repo is under heavy WIP. I'm currently getting the code from RAD's (Epic Games) Debugger over to a standalone state while at the same time studying it.**

This is a fork that aims to make the latest version of metadesk available from the [RAD Debugger]() accessible as a standalone library.

The library will be provided in 3 forms:

* As-is: (the way its laid out in this repo)
* c11: Setup ergonomically as a c11 library (both segregtated and as a single-header)
* cpp17: Setup ergonoically for usage as a C++ 17 library (both segregated and as a single-header)

docs will be updated referencing content procued by Ryan Fleury and content based on studying or resolving this library for this repo.
