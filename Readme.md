# Metadesk Library

WIP: This hosts the raddbg's version of the `mdesk` module lifeted for use as a library. Intent is to get it working with tests & examples as the original was able to. Then, reduce the surface area of the base & os mdoules that it was dependent on (from metagen) to a minimal size. Before dependency reduction, the modules will be hosted on a separate repo as a frozen state of their "libification".
